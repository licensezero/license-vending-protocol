# Schemas

## Metadata

Metadata indicate that a library, package, or other artifact is available under additional, paid license terms.

If the manifest format for the artifact supports arbitrary additional data, licensing metadata appear in that manifest under a `licensing` key.  Otherwise, licensing metadata appear in a separate `licensing.json` file in the root directory of the artifact.

## Licenses

Licenses indicate that a user has bought a license for an artifact.
